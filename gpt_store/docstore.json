Without a college degree, women earn substantially\nless pay, receive far fewer employer benefits, and are less likely to be financiallyindependent. As a gateway to economic success and security, college is a defining experience.\nDrawing the Line: Sexual Harassment on Campus reveals that colleges and universities\nstill have work to do to foster a campus climate that is free from bias and harass-ment so that all students have an equal opportunity to excel in higher education.As this research documents, most college students experience some type ofsexual harassment while at college, often during their first year. From unwantedsexual remarks to forced sexual contact, these experiences cause students, espe-cially female students, to feel upset, uncomfortable, angry, and disappointed in\ntheir colle ge experience .In response , students avoid places on campus, change\ntheir schedules, drop classes or activities, or otherwise change their lives to avoid\nsexual harassment. While many colleges and universities have policies in place,sexual harassment continues to have a damaging impact on the educational experi-ences of many college students.\nFor more than a decade the AAUW Educational Foundation has played a leader-\nship r ole in combating the problem of sexual harassment in education. AAUW\u2019s\ngroundbreaking research documented the extent and effects of sexual harassmentin public schools.\nHostile Hallways: Bullying, Teasing and Sexual Harassment in School\n(2001) r evealed per sistently high rates of sexual harassment among eighth through\n11th g raders and spurred national attention to the issue of sexual harassment in\nK\u201312 sc hools .\nWith Drawing the Line , we examine this issue at the next level of education\u2014\ncolleges and universities. Viewed as exemplars of diversity and inclusiveness,colle ges and universities play an important role in influencing the attitudes and\nbehaviors of young adults. At a time when colleges and universities are servingmore students than e ver, creating a campus climate that is free from bias and\nharassment is a necessary challenge for the higher education community. We \nhope that this research sparks new dialogue about sexual harassment and prompts inno vative strategies for building harassment-free campuses.\nBarbara O\u2019Connor, President\nAAUW Educational FoundationDecember 2005", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2484, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ecf693ea-a491-4378-a46f-0f9851c1f0c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "ecf693ea-a491-4378-a46f-0f9851c1f0c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "xi", "file_name": "DTLFinal.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "89435f77-1f87-4887-b878-c0f87144f84d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "xi", "file_name": "DTLFinal.pdf"}, "hash": "84d323d8f24e3d4a8569a7f55a91d3494805281a29635017b46aea04c2fa146a"}}, "hash": "84d323d8f24e3d4a8569a7f55a91d3494805281a29635017b46aea04c2fa146a", "text": "AAUW Educational Foundation vAcknowledgments\nThe survey for this research was conducted by\nHarris Interactive\u00ae.

The report is part of AAUW\u2019scontin uing w ork to ad dress the pr oblem of\nsexual har assment in educa tion.

The resource\nguide Harassment-Free Hallways: How to Stop Sexual\nHarassment in School (2001) is one of AAUW\u2019s\nmost requested publications.\nWith this new report AAUW takes the issue of\nsexual harassment to the next level of education:colle ges and uni versities. Women have made\ntremendous gains in higher education and are\nnow a majority of America\u2019s college students,yet anecdotal evidence of a \u201cchilly climate\u201d for\nfemale students, especially in traditionally male-dominated disciplines, is widespread. Aside fromdocumenting criminal behavior such as rape and sexual assault, little research has been done on the prevalence of sexual harassment on college campuses.\nThis research examines how college students\nperceive, experience, and respond to a wide rangeof unwanted sexual behaviors. Chapter 1 definessexual harassment, distinguishing between anarrow legal definition of the term and thebroader definition used in this research, and\ndescribes ho w college students define the term.\nChapter 2 describes the prevalence of sexual\nharassment, including the perceptions ofstudents who have been sexually harassed as well as the rationales of students who admit toharassing others. Chapter 3 examines theemotional and educational impact of sexualharassment, including students\u2019 recommenda-tions for improving the campus climate. Thereport concludes with a call for dialogue and\nincludes questions that should be addressed.\nKey Resear ch Findings\nSexual harassment is common on \ncollege campuses.\nSexual harassment is widespread among college\nstudents acr oss the country. A majority of college\nstudents experience sexual harassment. Morethan one-third encounter sexual harassmentduring their first year. A majority of studentsexperience noncontact f orms of harassment\u2014\nfrom sexual remarks to electronic messages\u2014and\nnearly one-third experience some form of phys-ical har assment, such as being touched, grabbed,\nor forced to do something sexual.

Supp. 654 (D.C.D.C.\n1976), as a form of sex discrimination in the\nworkplace under Title VII of the Civil Rights Actof 1964, which prohibits employment discrimina-\ntion on the basis of race, color, national origin,\nreligion, and sex. Ten years later in \nMeritor Savings\nBank v. Vinson , 477 U.S. 57 (1986), the Supreme\nCourt provided guidance on determining if\nharassing conduct is unwelcome as well as clari-\nfying the level of employer liability.In the educational arena, sex discrimination is\nprohibited in any educational program or activity\nthat receives federal funding under Title IX of\nthe Education Amendments of 1972. TheSupreme Court affirmed in 1992 that sexual\nharassment is a form of sex discrimination under\nTitle IX when it ruled in \nFranklin v. Gwinnett\nCounty Public Schools, 503 U.S. 60 (1992), that\nstudents could seek monetary damages for sexualharassment from educational institutions. Sincethen, the number of sexual harassment casesagainst colleges and universities, as well as K\u201312public schools, has grown considerably.\nThe Leg al Definition\nLawyers, policy-makers, and educators have\nattempted to provide a standard definition and a\ncommon set of guidelines f or se xual har assment.\nThe U.S. Department of Education Office for\nCivil Rights (OCR) is charged with interpreting\nand enforcing Title IX.3OCR\u2019s guidance on\nsexual har assment (1997) r ecognizes tw o types of\nsexual harassment in educational institutions:\nquid pro quo harassment and hostile environ-ment harassment. Quid pro quo harassment\ninvolves requests for sexual favors, generally by a\nschool employee to a student, in exchange for\nsome type of educational participation or benefit.\nHostile en vironment harassment entails harassing\nsexual conduct that is so severe, persistent, or\npervasive that it limits a student\u2019s ability to partic-ipate in or benefit from educational activities.\nCourts have held colleges, universities, and K\u201312\nschools liable for student-to-student and teacher-to-student sexual harassment under Title IX (see \nDavis v. Monroe County Board of Education ,\nAAUW Educational Foundation 7A\n3Any school tha t receives federal funding (and nearly all do) must comply with Title IX.

Lago Vista\nIndependent School District , 524 U.S. 274 [1998]).\nWith respect to student-to-student harassment,the Supreme Court stated in \nDavis that the term\n\u201csexual harassment\u201d applied only to misconductthat is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offen-sive that it effectively deprives the harassedstudent of access to educational opportunities.To hold a school liable for monetary damages,the student would have to demonstrate thatschool officials had actual knowledge of theharassment and were deliberately indifferent to it.\nDeter mining what is sufficiently severe, perva-\nsive, and objectively offensive can be compli-\ncated. As this research demonstrates, people\ndisagree on the severity of the problem. What isa laughing matter for one student may be offen-sive to another and traumatic to yet another,especially in the campus community, which teemswith students and staff from a diversity of back-grounds and perspectives. In this context thelegal standard is limited in its ability to serve as a ca talyst to change behavior.\nAn Academic Definition\nNearly all colleges and universities try to provide\nguidance on the issue of sexual har assment. In \na guidebook on college administration, Sandler\nand Shoop (1997, p. 4) define sexual harassment\nas follows:\nUnwelcome sexual advances, requests for\nsexual favors, and other verbal or physicalconduct of a sexual nature constitutesexual harassment when any one of thefollowing is true: (1) submission to suchconduct is made either e xplicitl y or\nimplicitly a term or condition of a\nperson\u2019s employment or academicadvancement; (2) submission to or rejec-\ntion of such conduct by an individual isused as the basis for employment deci-\nsions or academic decisions affecting theperson; (3) such conduct has the purposeor effect of unreasonably interfering with a person\u2019s work or academicperformance or creating an intimidating,hostile, or offensive working, learning,or social environment.\nSimilar language can be found in school policies\nat universities and colleges around the country.Student handbooks, websites, and other writtenpolicies and procedures constitute efforts byschools to comply with Title IX. As discussed inChapter 3, these ef forts by colleges and universi-\nties to pr ovide guidance are common yet do not\nappear to translate into changed behavior amongstudents on campus.\nIn the past few decades researchers have\ncontributed significantly to our understanding of\nsexual harassment in college, although it is diffi-cult to compare studies as they vary considerablyin scope and methodology. Several major studiesfocus on the experiences of K\u201312 students\n(AAUW , 1993 and 2001; Stein, Marshall, andTropp,1993; U.S. Department of Education,\nOffice of the Under Secr etary, 2004). Others\nfocus on female undergraduate and graduate\nstudents (Dziec h and Weiner ,1990; Glaser and\nThorpe, 1986; Sandler and Shoop, 1997; U.S.\nDepartment of Justice, National Institute of\nJustice, 2000) or on individual institutions (Lott,\nReilly, and Howard, 1982; Riggs, Murrell, and\nCutting , 2000; Kelley and Parsons, 2000).\nCombined, these and other studies offer a valu-\nable body of research on the issue of sexual\nharassment. Until now, however, no nationallyrepresentative study has used the same surveyquestions to examine sexual harassment amongboth male and f emale colle ge students .\n8 Drawing the Line: Sexual Harassment on Campus", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3433, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "96ea744b-7863-4e86-80d5-20eb990e47f4": {"__data__": {"id_": "96ea744b-7863-4e86-80d5-20eb990e47f4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "73", "file_name": "DTLFinal.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e8c49c6f-b5fe-4604-aacb-90e1806ebf7b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "73", "file_name": "DTLFinal.pdf"}, "hash": "cce250c97ea47e0f0d3577f2c89e7baeba2458b4d014f22526e4de70b6af1482"}}, "hash": "cce250c97ea47e0f0d3577f2c89e7baeba2458b4d014f22526e4de70b6af1482", "text": "College Students Define \nSexual Harassment\nThis survey asked students to define sexual\nharassment in their own words before they were\nprovided with the definition used for the\nremainder of the survey. Although nearly allstudents (97 percent) are confident that they\nknow what sexual harassment is, they offer a\nrange of definitions. Some refer to unwelcomesexual remarks or suggestions while othersinclude both verbal and physical advances. Somestudents define it as peer to peer while otherspoint to the abuse of authority by a faculty\nmember or resident adviser.\nDespite the variety of definitions, students agree\non some common themes. The majority of\ncollege students recognize sexual harassment tobe some type of unwanted or unwelcome\nbehavior or combination of behaviors. The most\ncommon student definitions include unwantedsexual conduct or behavior; unwanted verbal\nsexual ad vances, comments, or name calling; or\nunwanted physical sexual advances.

In a f ew instances, a noncontact behavior\nwas rated as more upsetting than a physicalbehavior. For example, most students say that\nhaving sexual rumors spread, being spied on, orhaving sexual messages posted on the Internet orvia e-mail would be more upsetting than beingtouched, grabbed, or pinched in a sexual way.\nMost students agree that sexual harassment is\nupsetting. Beneath this common ground,however, lie some significant differences.\n4Male\nand female students part ways considerably,with female students more likely to say theywould be upset by every type of harassment (see Figure 1). For example, only half of malestudents (54 percent) say they would be upset if someone intentionally brushed up against\nthem in a sexual way. In contrast, 90 percent of\nfemale students say this type of behavior wouldupset them. Male students are also much lesslikely than female students to say they would be upset by sexual comments, jokes, gestures, orlooks or b y sexual pictur es, photographs, illustra-\ntions, message, or notes. These gender differ-ences are quite remarkable as they are statisticallysignificant f or all 15 types of sexual har assment\nlisted in the survey.\nAlthough less striking, some differences by race\nand ethnicity are also found in student reactionsto hypothetical examples.

For example, nearly all women (97 percent) say they would be very upset if theywere forced to do something sexual other thankissing. In contrast, only 72 percent of men saythey would be very upset if they were forced to\ndo something sexual other than kissing.\nLesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT)\nand heter osexual students r eact in similar w ays to\nhypothetical e xamples. For a few types of sexualharassment, LGBT students are less likely to be\nvery or somewhat upset than are heterosexualstudents. Differences may exist within gendersbetween LGBT students and heterosexualstudents, but the sample size is insufficient tomake these observations. Notable differencesbetween LGBT and heterosexual students aremore evident in terms of prevalence and reac-tions to personal experiences. These differencesare discussed in subsequent chapters.\nSummary \nDefining sexual harassment is not simple. While\nfederal standards exist, in most cases and in mostcontexts an element of subjectivity determines\nwhat is and is not sexual harassment. As the law\nsuggests,colle ge administrators and others\ninvolved in adjudicating disputes about sexualharassment are supposed to imagine what areasona ble per son w ould think. This research\nreveals just how problematic this approach can\nbe. While college students agree that \u201cunwanted\u201dis a necessary part of any definition of sexual\nharassment, opinions about specific behaviors\nvary considerably.

About half of college\nstudents have been the target of unwanted sexual\ncomments, jokes, gestures, or looks, and a similarnumber know someone personally who experi-enced this type of harassment. Being called gay,lesbian, or a homophobic name is also a commonexperience among college students. More thanone-third know someone who has been calledgay, lesbian, or a homophobic name, and aboutone-quarter of students have had this happen to them. Physical forms of harassment are alsoprevalent.

Among students who have encountered\nharassment, male students (45 percent) are morelikely than female students (35 percent) to have\nbeen sexually harassed in their dorm or student\nhousing, while female students are more likely to have been harassed outside on campusgrounds (43 percent versus 29 percent). Malestudents (9 percent) are also more likely thanfemale students (3 percent) to have encounteredsexual harassment in a locker room or bathroom.\nAt All Types of Institutions\nSexual har assment ha ppens a t all kinds of\ncolle ges,but it is somewhat more prevalent at\nlarger schools. Students attending small colleges\nwith fewer than a thousand undergraduates areless lik ely to sa y tha t sexual harassment happens\non their campus. Almost one-third of thesestudents (27 percent) say that sexual harassmentnever happens at their college, compared to \n8 percent of students attending large schools\n(10,000 or more undergraduates). The differencesby size of school are most pronounced regarding\nsexual harassment of students by professors,\nteaching assistants, and other school employees.About 70 percent of students at large schools \nsay that professors, teaching assistants, or other\nschool employees sexually harass students on\ntheir campus, compared to about half of students\n(50 per cent) at small schools. In both cases,\nhowever, most students say that it does not\nhappen often. We also examined differencesamong students attending colleges in urban,suburban, or rural locations but found no statisti-\ncally significant differences.Sexual harassment appears to be less common \nat two-year colleges than at four-year colleges and universities. More than half of students (57 percent) attending two-year colleges andnearly three-fourths of students (71 percent) atfour-year colleges say that students harass otherstudents often or occasionally. Conversely, almostone-third of students (32 percent) attendingtwo-year colleges and about one-fifth of students(21 percent) at four-year colleges say that studentsrarely or never sexually harass other students.Half of students (50 percent) at two-year collegessay they know someone personally who has been\nsexually harassed, compared to 70 percent of\nstudents a t four-year colleges. About half of\nstudents (48 percent) at two-year colleges say that they have been sexually harassed, comparedto 65 percent of students at four-year institutions.\nThese differences reflect in part the shorter\nlength of time that students attend two-year insti-tutions. They may also reflect the fact thatstudents attending two-year colleges are morelikely to live at home with their parents. Among\nour sample, 60 percent of students at two-yearcolle ges compar ed to 25 per cent of students\nattending f our-year colle ges lived at home with\ntheir par ents. Conversely, 44 percent of students\nat four-year institutions and 4 percent of studentsat two-year colleges lived on campus. Since thedorm or student housing is the location cited bystudents as the most lik ely spot for sexual harass-\nment, it mak es sense tha t students w ho do not\nlive on campus are less likely to encounter harass-\nment there. Indeed, only about one-fifth oftwo-year college students (22 percent) who havebeen harassed have encountered sexual harass-ment at a dorm or student housing, compared to 43 percent of the same group attending four-year colle ges.\n7\n7The proportion of students at two-year colleges who say they encountered sexual harassment in student housing or a\ndorm is larger than the proportion who live on campus.

Less than 10 percent of female students\nhave been sexually harassed by another woman \n(9 percent) or group of women (6 percent).\nFor male students who have been sexually harassed,\nthe picture is more complicated. About one-thirdhave been harassed by one man (37 percent) or one woman (33 percent), and about one-fifthhave been harassed by a group of men (21 percent)or a group of both men and women (23 percent).\nA relatively large number of students (13 percent\ntotal, 20 percent male, 7 percent female) are notsure who har assed them. Presumably, these inci-\ndents (e.g., spreading rumors, posting messages)were conducted anon ymousl y.\nAbout four in 10 college students (41 percent)\nadmit to harassing someone. Among thesestudents, noncontact types of sexual harassmentare most common. For example, one-third of\nthese students (34 per cent) sa y the y made\nunwanted sexual comments, jokes, gestures, orlooks, and 17 percent admit to making homo-phobic r emar ks (see Figur e 6).\nMore than half ofmale college students \n(51 percent) admit that they have sexuallyharassed someone in colle ge,and mor e than \none-fifth (22 percent) admit to harassing\nsomeone often or occasionally. One-fifth ofmale students (20 percent) say that they havephysically harassed someone.\nAlthough men are more likely to be cited as\nharassers and to admit to harassing behaviors, theproblem of campus sexual harassment does notrest solely with college men. Of the students whohave been harassed, one-fifth (20 percent) havebeen har assed b y a female .Almost one-third of\nfemale students (31 percent) admit to committing\nsome type of harassment. These findings remind\nus that not all men are sexual aggressors and notall women are passive victims. Both male and\nfemale students can and do behave in ways thatare viewed by others as overly sexually aggressive.\nThe distinction between harasser and victim is\nalso not so clear, as many students who admit toharassing others have been harassed themselves.Among students who have been the target ofsexual harassment, a majority (55 percent) saythat they have harassed others. In contrast, ofstudents who have never been harassed, only 17 percent say they have harassed others. Morethan one-fifth of students (21 percent) who havebeen har assed say that they have harassed others\noften or occasionall y.\nThese patterns reflect, in part, differences \nin the willingness of students to recognizeunwanted sexual conduct in themselves andothers. These patterns also suggest a cycle of sexual harassment.\nWhy Do Students Harass?\nHarassers give the following reasons for \ntheir behavior:\n\u2022 I thought it was funny (59 percent)\n\u2022I thought the per son lik ed it (32 percent)\n\u2022 It\u2019s just a part of school life/a lot of people do\nit/it\u2019s no big deal (30 per cent)\n\u2022 I wanted a date with the person (17 percent)\n\u2022My friends encouraged/\u201cpushed\u201d me into\ndoing it (10 percent)\n\u2022 I wanted something from that person\n(7 per cent)\n\u2022 I wanted that person to think I had some sort\nof power over them (4 percent)\nMale students (63 percent) are more likely than\nfemale students (54 per cent) to think se xual\nharassment is funny. Some differences are also\nevident among r acial/ethnic groups.

Sexual harassment is more common\non large campuses than smaller ones and more\nprevalent at four-year colleges than two-year\ncolle ges. Sexual harassment is more common at\nprivate than public colleges (although public\ncollege students are more likely to say it is\nhappening on their campus). Both male andfemale students can be targets of sexual harass-\nment, although they tend to experience different\ntypes of harassment. LGBT students are more\nlikely than their heterosexual peers to experience sexual harassment.\nAlthough both male and female students harass,\nmale students are more likely to be named as\nharassers and to admit to harassing others.\nHarassers justify their behavior by noting thatthey thought it was funny or the other personliked it.\nIt is easy to conflate what is normal or common\nwith what is acceptable. Prevalence should not, inand of itself, imply tacit approval. Students donot speak out against sexual harassment for manyreasons, even if they are deeply troubled by it. Inthe following chapter we look at students\u2019 reac-tions to se xual harassment and the impact of\nharassment on students\u2019 emotional well-beingand their educational experiences.\n24 Drawing the Line: Sexual Harassment on Campus", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1792, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "67860cd4-e856-455e-a28e-bb12d9bc766c": {"__data__": {"id_": "67860cd4-e856-455e-a28e-bb12d9bc766c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "89", "file_name": "DTLFinal.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0814aa59-94f8-4f87-98c5-656658e4157b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "89", "file_name": "DTLFinal.pdf"}, "hash": "ebbe329397828ddfa6a05625e6e76d89360e413532f5f39005ebc32cd0f3a627"}}, "hash": "ebbe329397828ddfa6a05625e6e76d89360e413532f5f39005ebc32cd0f3a627", "text": "Dealing With Sexual Harassment on Campus3", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 41, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1086e5b7-5a60-40db-859e-fdfaac9a0410": {"__data__": {"id_": "1086e5b7-5a60-40db-859e-fdfaac9a0410", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "90", "file_name": "DTLFinal.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "79a921a1-b983-40ff-a903-b1d6ce51b43a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "90", "file_name": "DTLFinal.pdf"}, "hash": "958fcb8c1d926d66fdfb33d0d69cb3b362d46e5861ef040bef23ece323fabaa8"}}, "hash": "958fcb8c1d926d66fdfb33d0d69cb3b362d46e5861ef040bef23ece323fabaa8", "text": "26 Drawing the Line: Sexual Harassment on CampusSexual Harassment Made Me Feel ...\n\u201cUpset and embarrassed.\u201d \u2013 Female, 2nd year\n\u201cBelittled, alone, uncomfortable.\u201d\n\u2013 Female, 5th y ear\n\u201cSlightly uncomfortable, but not threatened.\u201d\n\u2013 Male, 3rd year\n\u201cSelf conscious, pissed of f, and concer ned, in \nthat order.\u201d \u2013 Female, 3rd year\n\u201cThey happen so often that I\u2019ve become very\nimmune to them.

Onone hand, nearly all college students have seensexually harassing behaviors\u2014as well as violentassault and rape\u2014on television, in magazines, orin movies. On the other hand, most students donot discuss their personal experiences with sexualharassment openly: 27 percent of female studentsand 44 percent of male students who haveencountered sexual harassment have never toldanyone. Dealing with sexual harassment in a\ncontradictory culture is a challenge for any insti-\ntution. For colleges and universities\u2014which are\nsimultaneously home, workplace, and learningenvironment\u2014drawing the line is especially chal-lenging. Nevertheless, dealing with sexual harass-ment on campus is essential to ensure a safe andwelcoming educational climate for all students.\nThis chapter examines the effects of sexual\nharassment on students\u2019 emotional well-beingand educa tional e xperiences. It discusses reac-\ntions to sexual harassment, ranging from indiffer-ence to embar rassment, anger,and f ear.\nDifferences betw een male and f emale students\nand dif ferences by sexual identity and race/\nethnicity are explored. The chapter examines howstudents deal with incidents of sexual harass-ment; whom they talk to, if anyone; and whetherthey report the incident to a school official. It\nconc ludes with students\u2019 recommenda tions f or\nhow colleges can address sexual harassment.\nReactions to Sexual Harassment\nAs discussed in Cha pter 1, colle ge students nearly\nuniversally vie w some kinds of sexual harassment\nas upsetting, while their reactions to other kinds\nare mor e mix ed. As Figure 1 reveals, nearly all\nstudents would be upset if someone pulled off\nor down their clothing, forced them to kiss, orforced them to do something se xual other than\nkissing. But only about half of students would be upset by unwanted sexual comments, jokes,\ngestures or looks, and a little less than half\nwould be upset if they were flashed or mooned.\nOverall, college students tend to view physicalforms of harassment as most upsetting, although \nsome noncontact conduct\u2014such as spreading\nsexual rumors or making quid pro quo requests\u2014is also viewed by nearly everyone as upsetting.\nDifferences between male and female reactions\nto sexual harassment are most evident whenstudents are asked about their personal experiences. The majority of female students (68 percent) say they have felt very or somewhatupset, compared to a third of male students (35 percent). The remaining two-thirds of malestudents (61 percent) say they have been eithernot very or not at all upset. In contrast, morethan one-fifth of female students (23 per cent) A\nSexual Harassment Affects My\nEducation Because ...\n\u201cIt makes me feel very uncomfortable and it affects\nmy willingness to accept the advice or lectures offered by professors.\u201d\n\u2013 Female, 4th year\n\u201cUncomfortable, did not want to be in class.\u201d\n\u2013 Female, no year given\n\u201cThey distract from the working environment and\nmake it harder to concentrate because youbecome paranoid.\u201d\n\u2013 Male, no year given\n\u201cIn school if you let things get to you, you aren\u2019t\nable to per form.

Female students are also more likely to worry (at least a little)\nabout sexual harassment. Only one-fifth of\nmale students (20 percent) say they worry,\ncompared to more than half of female students\n(54 per cent). Very few male or female students\n(1 to 2 per cent), however, say they worry about\nsexual harassment often.\nDifferences by emotional reaction also occur\nbetween lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgenderstudents (LGBT) and heterosexual students.While equall y upset b y hypothetical examples,\nLGBT students are more likely to feel upset by\ntheir actual experiences with sexual harassmentthan ar e heter osexual students (see Figur e 8).\nImpact on Educa tion\nSexual har assment has an impact on the educa-\ntional experience in large and small ways.Most commonl y,students a void the person\nwho harasses them (38 percent) and stay \naway from particular buildings or places on\ncampus (19 per cent). Only a handful of\nstudents c hang e colle ges (3 percent), but about \n6 percent think about transferring colleges \nas a r esult of sexual harassment.\nSome students ar e mor e likely to be adversely\naffected by sexual harassment. Female students\nare more likely than male students to have theireducational experience disrupted (see Figure 9).I Didn\u2019t Tell Anyone About Sexual\nHarassment Because ...\n\u201cDon\u2019t know.

Female students are morelikely to talk to someone, usually a friend, about\nsexual harassment.

Students may not want to get upset aboutsomething that \u201chappens so often it almost\nfeels normal.\u201d Some students may assume thatthe prevalence of sexual harassment is a signthat other people think that it is okay, and thesestudents may prefer to ignore its negativeeffects rather than be singled out as different.\nSecond, changes in traditional gender roles\nfurther complicate the question of where todraw the line. For young men, asserting andexhibiting masculinity remains paramount. Be a man! Don\u2019t be a girl, a sissy, a fag. Yet collegewomen also find themselves in strange waters.They, too, receive messages that they can and\nshould asser t themselves sexually, but the\nmessa ges about how to do so are confusing.\nShould they be sexually aggressive? If so, arethey to blame if they experience sexual harass-ment? These young women second-guess theiractions (and inactions) and tend to sweep actualincidences of sexual harassment under the rug.\nThird, questions remain about the role of\nsexual harassment as a precursor to moreviolent f orms of sexual aggression. Do we need\nto draw the line on jokes and comments toprevent mor e severe behaviors? If we tolerate\nsome beha viors,must we tolerate all? Is there \na relationship between some forms of sexual\nhumor and hostility toward female and LGBTstudents? These questions must be addressed asthe relative silence of the campus communitysends the wrong message and implies approvalwhen, in fact, many students and educators may\nbe una ware of the extent of the problem or\nunsure of how to tackle it.\nFourth, the line is not the same for everyone.\nVariations are evident among individuals andgroups. For example, female and LGBT students are more negatively affected. To a lesser e xtent, differences also occur by race \nand ethnicity. These differences raise the issue \nofequity in education.

At the same time, a campusculture that tolerates sexual harassment has impli-cations that extend far beyond the campuscommunity. Attitudes and behaviors that areestablished in college will find their way into allaspects of society, from the workplace to thecourtroom to family life.\nDialogue is the first step toward drawing the line\non sexual harassment on campus. The point isnot merely to avoid lawsuits\u2014although dialogueon the issue should help to do this\u2014but to fostera climate on college campuses that supports\nrather than stifles students\u2019 emotional well-being\nand intellectual g rowth.\nSome important questions to consider for this\ndialogue include the following:\n\u2022 Who is responsible for ensuring that this\ndialogue occurs? Is it the students themselves,college and university administrators, faculty, orsomeone else?\n\u2022 How are college faculty and staff promoting a\nculture of respect and fairness? Are they toler-ating or e ven initiating sexual harassment?\u2022 Should there be different standards for\ndifferent places on campus? For example,should there be special standards for studenthousing, classrooms, or other areas? \n\u2022 How can colleges and universities help students\ndeal with sexual harassment before it reachesthe stage of a formal complaint? \n\u2022 How can colleges and universities raise aware-\nness of Title IX as a resource and a tool to stopsexual harassment?\n\u2022 How can college students help each other deal\nwith contradictory messages about sexuallyaggressive behavior?\n\u2022 How can colleges and universities proactively\nseek information about the extent and natureof the problem on their campus?\n\u2022How can those outside the academic commu-\nnity participate in these efforts?\nSexual harassment defies a simple solution but\ndemands action.

A large-panel-assembly methodwas used, meaning that a stratified randomsample was selected from the Harris Poll Online,a panel of several million individuals who opt toparticipate in online surveys. Individuals weresent password-protected e-mail invitations toparticipate in a survey about college experiences.Interviews were completed with 2,036 U.S. resi-dents ages 18 to 24 who were enrolled in collegebetween January and May 2005. Online inter-\nviews averaged 17 minutes.\nPopula tion\nThe most r ecent census found that the popula-\ntion of college students ages 18 to 24 residing in\nthe United States in 2000 was approximately nine\nmillion\u2014about one-third (34 percent) of the 27 million Americans in this age group (U.S.Census Bureau, 2003, p. 9). About 4.9 millioncollege students were women and about 4.2 million w ere men. More than six million\n(6.3 million) students identified themselv es as\nwhite non-Hispanic (non-Latino/Latina). Aboutone million b lack indi viduals and a bout 944,000\nHispanic indi viduals a ges 18 to 24 w ere attending\ncolle ge in 2000.\nThe National Center for Education Statistics esti-\nmated tha t ther e were 13 million under graduate\ncollege students in 2000, rising to 14.8 million by\n2005 (U.S. Department of Education, NationalCenter f or Educa tion Statistics, 2005). Assuming\nthat the proportion of undergraduates (69 percent)\nwho are between the ages of 18 and 24 does notchange between 2000 and 2005, we estimate thepopulation of undergraduate students in this agegroup to be about 10 million in 2005. We expectthat a little mor e than half are female and a little\nless than half are male.Sample\nE-mail invitations for this study were sent to a\nstratified random sample of the Harris databaseidentified as students ages 18 to 24 residing in theUnited States. Full-time and part-time studentswere included. Respondents were enrolled in anundergraduate program at a postsecondarycollege or university between January and May2005 and did not take most of their classesonline or by mail. Only current undergraduatestudents and individuals who had graduatedwithin the past six months were included. Thesample included students enrolled in public andprivate postsecondary schools, including institu-\ntions offering two- and four-year degrees. For\nexample, students enrolled at a communitycolle ge were inc luded in the survey; students\ntaking a c lass or c lasses in a nondegree program\nwere not included. The age range was limited \nto facilitate analysis and does not reflect an\nassumption that sexual harassment is confined to this population.\nWeighting of Data\nData were weighted to reflect the U.S. population\nages 18 to 24 who are current or recent college\nstudents at either a two- or four-year collegeaccording to demographic variables such asgender ,age, race/ethnicity, education, region, and\nincome. A post weight was also applied to adjust\nqualified r espondents to more accurately reflect\nthe proportions of male and female studentsbetween the ages of 18 and 21 and the ages of22 and 24.

The size of the potentialsampling error varies with the number of peopleanswering the survey question and the size of thedifference expressed in the results. In otherwords, for a difference to be \u201creal,\u201d it must be ofa certain size. For example, this research foundthat 62 percent of students have experiencedsexual harassment at college and 38 percent of\nstudents have not experienced it. The confidence\ninterval is +/-2, meaning that if we were to askthis question 100 times to r andom g roups of\ncolle ge students ages 18 to 24, we would expect\nthat 95 times out of 100 between 60 and \n64 percent of students would say they had expe-\nrienced sexual harassment and between 36 and40 percent of students would say that they havenot. All comparisons discussed in this report arestatistically significant at the 95 percent confi-dence le vel unless otherwise indica ted.\nUse of Online Methodology\nAn online sur vey was selected as the best\nmethodolo gy for this r esear ch for several\nreasons. First, research suggests that Internet\nsurveys\u2014specifically those using the large panelmethod\u2014appear to be as reliable as telephonesurveys (Ber rens, Bohara, Jenkins-Smith, Silva,\nand Weimer, 2003). For the past 30 years, most\nsurveys have been conducted by telephone, butthis method has become incr easing ly difficult as\ntelemarketing, solicitations for charities, and\n\u201cpush polls\u201d compete with social scientists forthe declining number of people willing to participate in phone surveys. Cellular telephonespresent another challenge as an increasingly large number of people , particularly college \nstudents, are disconnecting from the land-line\nsystem alto gether.Second, college students are more likely than the\ngeneral population to have access to computersand the Internet and more likely to use themoften. According to research by the Pew Internet& American Life Project (Jones, 2002), the vastmajority of college students use the Internet forboth research and entertainment. At the sametime that college students are particularly difficultto reach by phone, they are especially easy toreach via the Internet.\nFinally, the case for an online methodology was\nespecially strong for this project because of itssubject matter. Sexual harassment is a sensitive\nand personal topic. Some students may feel\nembarrassed to talk about these issues. AsChapter 3 r eveals, a sizeable number of students\n\u2014especiall y male students\u2014ha ve never discussed\ntheir se xual harassment experience with anyone,\neven a friend. An online format where questions\nare presented on the screen rather than asked inperson is also preferable because the gender ofthe interviewer is not apparent.\nUse of Language\nCareful a ttention should be paid to the langua ge\nused in the survey and in this report. For theexact w ording of the questions ,see the sur vey\nquestionnair e at www .aauw .org/research. The\nsurvey included a standard definition and a list of\n15 behaviors that could be considered sexualharassment if they are unwanted (see Page 6).The sur vey specifies tha t we are discussing sexual\nharassment in the context of the educational\nenvironment. Respondents are reminded atseveral points during the survey to consider \nonly those experiences from \u201ccollege-related\nevents or activities.\u201d Sexual harassment outside of the college context is not the subject ofthis report.\nAt some places in this r eport,we delineate\nbetween contact and noncontact forms of\nharassment, with examples one through seven \n44 Drawing the Line: Sexual Harassment on Campus", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3783, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5f424027-aec8-49dd-b349-380a66177b1d": {"__data__": {"id_": "5f424027-aec8-49dd-b349-380a66177b1d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "109", "file_name": "DTLFinal.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b5050b64-0121-4474-8fe5-215add0b3710", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "109", "file_name": "DTLFinal.pdf"}, "hash": "cfaffc0735420cb4e2e195f0cf20792cb19a9821dfbc1cba07f0d2613dc3a256"}}, "hash": "cfaffc0735420cb4e2e195f0cf20792cb19a9821dfbc1cba07f0d2613dc3a256", "text": "AAUW Educational Foundation 45in the questionnaire defined as noncontact and \neight through 15 defined as contact. This is apoint of analysis; no such distinction was made in the survey itself. The examples of these formsof harassment were grouped together but not differentiated as contact or noncontact to the respondent.\nIt should not be assumed that the impact of\nsexual harassment involving physical contact isnecessarily \u201cmore severe\u201d than the impact ofnonphysical harassment. For example, unwantedsexual comments from a respected professor or a trusted friend could be more damaging for\nsome students than being grabbed in a sexual \nway by a stranger. Because the examples listedbegin with se xual comments and jok es and end\nwith f orced sexual activity, however, students \nmay have assumed that this order represented \na severity ranking.
